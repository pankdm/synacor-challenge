3) - The self-test completion code is: GNIbaFAvOpUX
4) - You find yourself writing "zHQkEJVhuWiv" on the tablet.  Perhaps it's some kind of code?
5) - Chiseled on the wall of one of the passageways, you see:

    OoUbplMyihTH
You take note of this and keep walking.

6) - You activate the teleporter!  As you spiral through time and space,

7) - You wake up on a sandy beach with a slight headache.
The last thing you remember is activating that teleporter...
but now you can't find it anywhere in your pack.
Someone seems to have drawn a message in the sand here:

    ZFnmWETrVUIK

It begins to rain.  The message washes away.
You take a deep breath and feel firmly grounded in reality
as the effects of the teleportation wear off.


8)
You gaze into the mirror, and you see yourself gazing back.
But wait!  It looks like someone wrote on your face while you were unconscious on the beach!
Through the mirror, you see "xOldxpxqd8ww" scrawled in charcoal on your forehead.
