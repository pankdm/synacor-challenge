# The cover of this book subtly swirls with colors.
# It is titled "A Brief Introduction to Interdimensional Physics".  It reads:
#
# Recent advances in interdimensional physics have produced fascinating
# predictions about the fundamentals of our universe!  For example,
# interdimensional physics seems to predict that the universe is, at its root, a
# purely mathematical construct, and that all events are caused by the
# interactions between eight pockets of energy called "registers".
# Furthermore, it seems that while the lower registers primarily control mundane
# things like sound and light, the highest register (the so-called "eighth
# register") is used to control interdimensional events such as teleportation.
#
# A hypothetical such teleportation device would need to have have exactly two
# destinations.  One destination would be used when the eighth register is at its
# minimum energy level - this would be the default operation assuming the user
# has no way to control the eighth register.  In this situation, the teleporter
# should send the user to a preconfigured safe location as a default.
#
# The second destination, however, is predicted to require a very specific
# energy level in the eighth register.  The teleporter must take great care to
# confirm that this energy level is exactly correct before teleporting its user!
# If it is even slightly off, the user would (probably) arrive at the correct
# location, but would briefly experience anomalies in the fabric of reality
# itself - this is, of course, not recommended.  Any teleporter would need to test
# the energy level in the eighth register and abort teleportation if it is not
# exactly correct.
#
# This required precision implies that the confirmation mechanism would be very
# computationally expensive.  While this would likely not be an issue for large-
# scale teleporters, a hypothetical hand-held teleporter would take billions of
# years to compute the result and confirm that the eighth register is correct.
#
# If you find yourself trapped in an alternate dimension with nothing but a
# hand-held teleporter, you will need to extract the confirmation algorithm,
# reimplement it on more powerful hardware, and optimize it.  This should, at the
# very least, allow you to determine the value of the eighth register which would
# have been accepted by the teleporter's confirmation mechanism.
#
# Then, set the eighth register to this value, activate the teleporter, and
# bypass the confirmation mechanism.  If the eighth register is set correctly, no
# anomalies should be experienced, but beware - if it is set incorrectly, the
# now-bypassed confirmation mechanism will not protect you!
#
# Of course, since teleportation is impossible, this is all totally ridiculous.
